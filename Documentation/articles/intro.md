# Reign's Vision

## Story

### Introduction

You are the leader of an empire captured by another empire trying to get information out of you. You must pilot one of the enemy starships to escape out of the space prison.

## Music Inspiration

As a longtime fan of [Rush Garcia](https://www.youtube.com/@RushGarcia), I would love it if we could get him to make the video game's soundtrack. Budget would be around $2,500.

### Mythrodak

I really enjoy the style of Mythrodak's [music for his introduction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t74_YgrOZlQ) to ["Escaping The Minecraft Abyss"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HagNTmHGMtQ). It would be awesome if there could be music that syncs up with the gameplay/cinematics that happen throughout this video game's introduction.

### Minecraft's Original Soundtrack

Minecraft's OST in the early 2010s was very soothing when played as ambient music. It would be great if the video game's ambient music could have the same vibe.

## Game Mechanics

### Visiting Planets

If the starship is near a planet, it has the option to land. The planets do not have collision so you cannot enter the planet's atmosphere without the player selecting to do so.

### Creating a Dyson Swarm

TODO: The question is how would you create a Dyson Sphere if the planets are not to scale?

A Dyson Sphere is a physically impossible task in real life, so we would only allow the creation of a Dyson Swarm, which is basically just a bunch of solar panels orbiting around a star.
