# Enemy Ideas

 - Disguise as asteroids (cool transform animation inspired by Michael Bay's Transformers)
 - Transfer detached modules to themselves to make themselves more powerful (inspired by the Witherstorm from Minecraft: Story Mode)
 - An enemy that can only cling onto asteroids in an asteroid field so it can move towards the player's army. In the process it can drag asteroids towards the army to wipe them all out at once
