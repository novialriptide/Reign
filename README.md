My general visual for the game is that you are the overseer of an entire spaceship fleet, which you can build or modify each individual spacecraft. As in build or modify, think of a tilemap, but each individual tile represents a part of the spacecraft (turret, thruster, etc). You can gather resources by sending your forces into raids or go asteroid mining. Iâ€™m thinking about adding a single player campaign, but not entirely sure if I should go deep into the lore since I do not know how many people are interested in this game concept.
